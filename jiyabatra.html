        <pre>            <h2> let's know something about her journey </h2>
            <p>
                At the age of only 16, Jiya started "MX TAKATAK" and made her MX profile as an artist (jiye the Coolartist).She uploaded
                her first video on August 15, 2020 which is a tutorial video recorded by his brother. But she doesn't know how to edit 
               it (basically she doesn't know how to fast forward it ) so, she recorded it again on the trending song.
               <a href="https://mojapp.in/jiya_the_coolartist/video/1017470723?referrer=U69x0AQ-XYCJH5&amp;source=link"> link of this video </a>
                
                Until she reached 1000 followers, Jiya used simple colors (caryon colors). 7 months later, on her birthday, she started
                using oil pastels. Similarly, when Jiya started thinking about becoming jiya_the_coolartist, she didn't even know there
                were colors called oil pastels. She is only interested in drawing.
                She came to know about different colors or different art medium after watching the video of Aryan Verma (Artist Boy).
               She learned a lot about art from the artist boy (Av bro)..
               jiya herself learned drawing while making video for long time .Making different and unique video on trending songs for long time
               which is different from other artists.
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFQWsAKVCXU&amp;list=PLVKgTfglLEQcwe_d3KBc0HQ2oQNFHc3o1&amp;index=12&amp;pp=gAQBiAQB">click here to watch what kind of trending video jiya make and how it is different </a>
               Rest,I believe that every artist is different .
              <mark>Do You know jiya has made the smallest 1000 drawing in a day ????</mark>
              <mark>ON 26 january 2022 jiya did 1000 smallest drawing in a day <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CZMZMy9FlbG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">you can watch this video by clicking there .</a></mark>
    
             In this journey , she watched many video of Amarjeet's sketch art and also saw many other artists and learned a lot from them .
             jiya also draw on rap song .

             <mark>There is another thing about Jiya which very few people know, when Jiya was seeing the reference of Kedarnath's drawing, in </mark>
       <mark>any drawing and in any photo, the pattern of the boundary  was not shown/clear nor the pattern  circle above it, then after </mark>
       <mark>searching it a lot, in a reel she found it and she has shown this pattern in her drawing which no artist has show till date</mark>
       <mark>,of course many artists have done very well drawing of Kedarnath than  Jiya, but no one paid attention to small details like her.</mark>
